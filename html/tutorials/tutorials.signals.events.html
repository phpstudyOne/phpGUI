   There is a lot of difference between <span dir="ltr"><tt>events</tt></span> and
   <span dir="ltr"><tt>signals</tt></span>, and both of them are far from interchangeable.
  </p><p>
   A signal is emitted by an instance of a <span dir="ltr"><a href="../gtk/gtk.gtkobject.html">GtkObject</a></span> in
   response to some action by the user or an instruction from a function or a
   method.
  </p><p>
   Events on the other hand, are a continual stream of impulses that communicate
   messages regarding the environmental changes in the underlying windowing
   system. These are rather low-level, that means that every small change in the
   environment counts as an event.
  </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 24px; font-weight: bold;">
   It is not possible to connect a callback to an event directly.
  </div><p>
   We had used the <span dir="ltr"><tt>enter-notify-event</tt></span> signal in our previous
   example. But it certainly sounds like it should be an event, isn't it? Many
   of the events have important applications and it is often necessary to be
   able to connect callbacks to them. For this purpose, PHP-GTK 2 provides
   several signals known as <span dir="ltr"><tt>event signals</tt></span> (such as
   <span dir="ltr"><tt>enter-notify-event</tt></span> and
   <span dir="ltr"><tt>leave-notify-event</tt></span>) that are actually wrappers over the
   events themselves. These are ways of describing events in terms of signals so
   that we can connects callbacks to them.
  </p><p>
   Whenever you require to capture an event, you would most probably find an
   equivalent signal to work with. In case you don't, it is possible for every
   widget that has its own <span dir="ltr"><a href="../gdk/gdk.gdkwindow.html">GdkWindow</a></span> to capture events
   relevant to it. For those widgets that don't have a
   <span dir="ltr"><a href="../gdk/gdk.gdkwindow.html">GdkWindow</a></span>, they must be encapsulated in a
   <span dir="ltr"><a href="../gtk/gtk.gtkeventbox.html">GtkEventBox</a></span> to be able to capture events. Capturing
   an event is not an easy task, and is beyond the scope of this tutorial. Like
   I said before, you will mostly find an equivalent signal to work with anyway,
   so don't worry too much about events.

   This tutorial explains how to obtain, compile and write or extend the
   official PHP-GTK 2 documentation - that is, the manual you are currently
   reading.
  </p><p>
   If you simply want to read the manual, this probably isn't of any interest
   to you.
  </p><p>
   The source for this documentation, along with the PHP-GTK 2 source and
   everything else that comes under the PHP project umbrella, resides on the
   PHP project's SVN server at
   <a href="http://svn.php.net" target="_top">svn.php.net</a>. It is loosely
   based on an XML dialect called <i>DocBook</i>, which was
   designed to be used for books and other forms of technical documentation.
   The reason the PHP-GTK documentation project can't adhere to strict DocBook
   syntax is that it has one major weakness: there is no DocBook syntax to
   support the documentation of object oriented languages. We had to design
   our own. This, in turn, means that the PHP-GTK Documentation Group also
   need to adapt other php.net mechanisms - such as livedocs and .chm builds
   - specifically to work with the php-gtk-doc syntax, whereas we could
   utilize those tools out of the box if we were able to use pure DocBook XML.
  </p><p>
   Despite this, there are several benefits in basing the manual on DocBook.
   The document (i.e. the entire manual) can be distributed over many files,
   so that the files are in handy pieces and many people can work concurrently
   on different parts of it. Further, the base XML files can be converted into
   many formats: plain HTML for offline reading, PHP code (as you can see in
   the online manual), Windows <span dir="ltr"><tt>.chm</tt></span> files, and
   <span dir="ltr"><tt>.pdf</tt></span> files, to name but a few.
  </p><p>
   A big disadvantage is that you need to compile the XML from the sources
   into the desired format, which can take quite some time. This manual
   consists of over 300 single files, and the compiled HTML version has
   more than 3000 generated files. Compilation takes 10 minutes on a 1.6GHz
   system; on a 400MHz it's around 40 to 45 minutes. To combat this problem,
   there is a single-page HTML version of the manual,
   <span dir="ltr"><tt>bigmanual.html</tt></span>, which builds in just a few minutes
   and which can be used to uncover any syntax errors in the source files.

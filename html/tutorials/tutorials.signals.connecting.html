   It should be clear by now that if you want to react to an action, you must
   connect its signal to a signal handler that you have written, so that 
   PHP-GTK 2 can call that function whenever the signal is triggered. Let's 
   look into how you can connect signals to signal handlers.
  </p><p>
   There are 4 main functions that you can use to connect signals to callbacks:
   <div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="idp44889696"></a>connect_simple</li><li><a name="idp44890080"></a>connect_simple_after</li><li><a name="idp44890464"></a>connect</li><li><a name="idp44890848"></a>connect_after</li></ul></div>
  </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 24px; font-weight: bold;">
   The *_after methods are used if you want your signal handlers to be invoked
   <i>after</i> the ones connected using
   <span dir="ltr"><tt>connect</tt></span> and <span dir="ltr"><tt>connect_simple</tt></span>. We will be 
   discussing only the <span dir="ltr"><tt>connect_simple</tt></span> and 
   <span dir="ltr"><tt>connect</tt></span> methods. The respective *_after methods behave in
   the same way except for the fact that the signal handler is guaranteed to be
   invoked only after those connected via <span dir="ltr"><tt>connect</tt></span> or
   <span dir="ltr"><tt>connect_simple</tt></span> have.
  </div><div class="sect2"><a name="tutorials.signals.connecting.simple"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tutorials.signals.connecting.simple"></a>Simple connections</h3></div></div><p>
    First we'll look into how to connect a signal to a signal handler in the most
    simplest way. We'll be using, you guessed it, the
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>connect_simple</tt></span> method.
   </p><p>
    Of course, it is vital that you know the names of the signals that you would
    want to connect to. The PHP-GTK 2 documentation contains a list of all signals 
    that are relevant for a particular widget. Once you know that, and once you
    have written a function that contains the code you want to be executed when
    the signal is generated all you have to do is:
    <table class="programlisting" dir="ltr"><tr><td><pre class="phpcode">
${widget}-&gt;connect_simple('{signal-name}', '{callback-name}');
 </pre></td></tr></table>
    where, {widget} is the object whose signal you want to connect,
    {signal-name} is the signal name, which of course must be relevant to
    {widget}, and {callback-name} is the name of the callback function.
   </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 24px; font-weight: bold;">
    Signal handlers are invoked whenever a signal is generated, by whatever means.
    Remember that it is possible to generate signals through functions, and hence
    a signal generation does not guarantee that the user has performed an
    action.
   </div><p>
    To make things a little clearer, let's take a full fledged example. Here, we
    add a button to a window. When a user clicks the button, the application
    quits:
    <div class="example" align="left"><p><a name="idp44901584"></a><b>Example 9.1. A simple connection</b></p><table class="programlisting" dir="ltr"><tr><td><pre class="phpcode">&lt;?php

$win = new GtkWindow();
$but = new GtkButton('Click to Quit!');

$win-&gt;add($but);
$win-&gt;show_all();

$but-&gt;connect_simple('clicked', 'quit');

function quit()
{
    echo "You have quit!\n";
    Gtk::main_quit();
}

Gtk::main();

?&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table></div>
   </p><p>
    It's quite a simple program. We create a button and a window, add the button
    to the window and show them. The line we are concerned with is:
    <table class="programlisting" dir="ltr"><tr><td><pre class="phpcode">
$but-&gt;connect_simple('clicked', 'quit');
 </pre></td></tr></table>
    As you can see, we have connected the 
    <span dir="ltr">"<a href="../gtk/gtk.gtkbutton.signal.clicked.html">clicked</a>"</span> signal of a
    <span dir="ltr"><a href="../gtk/gtk.gtkbutton.html">GtkButton</a></span> widget to the signal handler named
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>quit</tt></span>. Simple, eh? The function <span dir="ltr"><tt>quit</tt></span>
    will be called whenever the <span dir="ltr"><tt>clicked</tt></span> signal is emitted
    from our button, or, whenever the user clicks on our button.
   </p><p>
    You can see in the <span dir="ltr"><tt>quit</tt></span> function definition that we
    display a message and then call the <span dir="ltr"><tt>Gtk::main_quit()</tt></span>
    function to exit the program.
   </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="tutorials.signals.connecting.multiple"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tutorials.signals.connecting.multiple"></a>Multiple Connections</h3></div></div><p>
    <i>What if I connect the same signal twice to two different
    callbacks?</i>, I hear you ask. Well, the signal handlers will simply 
    be called in the order in which they were connected. 
   </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 24px; font-weight: bold;">
    If any of your signal handlers return <span dir="ltr"><tt>true</tt></span> then no more
    signal handlers will be called for the current signal being handled. This is
    a useful way of controlling logic when you have multiple signal handlers.
   </div><p>
    An example to make things crystal clear:
    <div class="example" align="left"><p><a name="idp44914144"></a><b>Example 9.2. Multiple signal connections</b></p><table class="programlisting" dir="ltr"><tr><td><pre class="phpcode">&lt;?php

$win = new GtkWindow();
$but = new GtkButton('Click to Quit!');

$win-&gt;add($but);
$win-&gt;show_all();

$but-&gt;connect_simple('clicked', 'first');
$but-&gt;connect_simple('clicked', 'second');
$but-&gt;connect_simple('clicked', 'third');

function first()
{
    echo "I am the first function!\n";
}

function second()
{
    echo "I am the second function!\n";
}

function third()
{
    echo "And I'm the function that's going to stop this program!\n";
    Gtk::main_quit();
}

Gtk::main();

?&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table></div>
    Run the program and you will see that signal handlers are indeed
    invoked in the order in which they were connected.
   </p><p>
    <i>OK, but what if I connect the signal to the same callback a hundred
    times?</i> The callback will be invoked a hundred times. But there's no
    reason anyone would want to do this.
   </p><p>
    <i>Can I connect multiple signals to the same callback?</i> 
    Yes, and in fact this is actually very useful. Many applications will have 
    multiple ways of quitting the program: the regular "cross" button, a "quit" 
    button on the file menu etc. You can connect signals for each one of them 
    to a single <span dir="ltr"><tt>quit</tt></span> function. You don't have to worry about 
    where the signal came from, you just know that the user wants to quit the 
    application.
   </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="tutorials.signals.connecting.advanced"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tutorials.signals.connecting.advanced"></a>Customizing connections</h3></div></div><p>
    Sometimes, its useful to know which widget had triggered a particular
    signal. If your application has more than one button, and you've connected
    all their <span dir="ltr"><tt>clicked</tt></span> signals to a single callback, you'd
    definitely want to know which button the signal came from. It is in fact
    efficient to write a single signal handler for multiple signals.
   </p><p>
    Here is where the <span dir="ltr"><tt>connect</tt></span> method comes into the picture.
    This method passes the object of the widget that generated the signal as the
    first parameter to the signal handler.
    <table class="programlisting" dir="ltr"><tr><td><pre class="phpcode">
$button1 = new GtkButton('First');
$button2 = new GtkButton('Second');

$button1-&gt;connect('clicked', 'show');
$button2-&gt;connect('clicked', 'show');

function show($whichbutton)
{
    echo $whichbutton-&gt;get_label();
}
 </pre></td></tr></table>    
    In the above example, you will get an output of "First" or "Second"
    depending on which button was clicked.
   </p><p>
    It is also useful at times if you could pass custom parameters to your
    signal handlers. PHP-GTK 2 provides this functionality in both the
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>connect</tt></span> and <span dir="ltr"><tt>connect_after</tt></span> methods. You
    simply pass your parameters after the second argument to both these methods
    separated by commas like this:
    <div class="example" align="left"><p><a name="idp44926992"></a><b>Example 9.3. Passing custom parameters</b></p><table class="programlisting" dir="ltr"><tr><td><pre class="phpcode">&lt;?php

$win = new GtkWindow();
$but = new GtkButton('Move over me!');

$win-&gt;add($but);
$win-&gt;show_all();

$win-&gt;connect_simple('destroy', array('gtk', 'main_quit'));
$but-&gt;connect_simple('enter-notify-event', 'showMessage', true, 'You moved the mouse');
$but-&gt;connect_simple('leave-notify-event', 'showMessage', false, 'You moved the mouse');

function showMessage($enter, $message)
{
    if ($enter) {
        echo $message." over the button!\n";
    } else {
        echo $message." away from the button!\n";
    }
}

Gtk::main();

?&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table></div>
    In this example, we pass two custom parameters to our signal handler that 
    helps us from differentiating whether the mouse entered the button or left 
    it. Note that your custom parameters can be of any type: string, boolean, 
    integer, an array or even an object, as long as its a valid type in PHP. 
    In fact, it is a very common necessity to pass widget objects as parameters
    to signal handlers, because a callback connected to a signal triggered by 
    some widget may need to modify some other widget. You may pass as many 
    custom parameters as you want. Just ensure that your signal handler is 
    designed to receive the same number of parameters, or you may raise 
    warnings.
   </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 24px; font-weight: bold;">
    For more information on signals such as
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>enter-notify-event</tt></span>, see the section on 
    <a href="tutorials.signals.events.html" title="Events">events</a>, because
    there is more to this than meets the eye.
   </div></div><div class="sect2"><a name="tutorials.signals.connecting.object"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tutorials.signals.connecting.object"></a>Object-oriented connections</h3></div></div><p>
    Let us analyze the line that you might have seen frequently:
    <table class="programlisting" dir="ltr"><tr><td><pre class="phpcode">
$window-&gt;connect_simple('destroy', array('gtk', 'main_quit'));
 </pre></td></tr></table>
    Why an array as the second argument?
   </p><p>
    Remember that whenever you connect to callback functions in an
    object-oriented context, the second argument to the connect_* functions must
    be an array. The first element of the array should point to the class that
    contains the callback and the second element must contain the name of the
    callback itself.
   </p><p>
    When the callback is static in nature (like
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>Gtk::main_quit()</tt></span>), we generally specify the name of the
    class as a string. However if the callback is not static in nature, but is a
    member of your current class instead, the first element should be the
    special <span dir="ltr"><tt>$this</tt></span> variable. Have a look at the tutorial on
    <a href="tutorials.objectorientation.advanced.html" title="A little more complexity">Object Oriented
    Programming</a> for examples of usage in such a context. The point is to
    somehow make the first element of the array point to the class that contains
    the callback and the second element point to the callback.

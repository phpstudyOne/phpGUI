    There are now two different build systems for the php-gtk-doc module;
    the standard one, used on the server and having several different build
    options, and the alternative one, which currently offers only the English
    version of the multiple HTML file build.
   </p><p>
    The chief advantage of the alternative build is that it makes it
    possible to compile the PHP-GTK manual under Windows without installing
    a Linux emulator such as <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_top">cygwin</a>.
    You will, however, need to install several native versions of
    <a href="http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">Unix tools</a> in order
    to set up the build environment for it. Installing these simply means
    unzipping them into your root directory, so this is an easy option if you
    don't have good enough connectivity or are otherwise precluded from
    installing cygwin on your local box.
   </p><p>
    Whichever build option you use, you will need to have
    <b>xsltproc</b> installed to process the XSL stylesheets. On
    a Linux system, you can install this with your package manager. If you are
    working under the cygwin environment, you can add it via the cygwin install
    mechanism. If you're using plain Windows, you can download the xsltproc
    binaries (you'll need the iconv, zlib, libxml2 and libxslt packages) from
    xmlsoft.org contributor Igor Zlatkovic's
    <a href="http://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html" target="_top">project site</a>
    and unzip them into your root directory.
   </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 24px; font-weight: bold;"><p>
     There are other XSLT processors around but, since we found xsltproc to be
     by far the fastest of the available alternatives, the stylesheets used to
     generate the PHP-GTK 2 manual now rely on it entirely.

    Before we can start changing or even compiling the manual, we need to get
    a copy from SVN. To accomplish this, you will need an SVN client. On nearly
    every Linux system, the command line <span dir="ltr"><tt>svn</tt></span> tool is
    installed. This is also available via cygwin. Under Windows, there are
    native point-and-click SVN clients available, such as
    <a href="http://www.tortoisesvn.org/" target="_top">Tortoise SVN</a>.
   </p><p>
    To get a copy of the docs using the <span dir="ltr"><tt>svn</tt></span> command line
    tool, type:
    <b>svn checkout http://svn.php.net/repository/gtk/php-gtk-doc/trunk php-gtk-doc</b>
   </p><p>
    If you already have a copy, you can update it via:
    <b>cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository update -Pd php-gtk-doc</b>
    (if you are inside the php-gtk-doc directory, you can (have to) omit the 
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>php-gtk-doc</tt></span> part.
   </p><p>
    To obtain a copy of the docs module using TortoiseCVS: go to
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>File/CVS checkout</tt></span> and fill out the form. The protocol
    is the <span dir="ltr"><tt>Password server (:pserver)</tt></span> option; the server is
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>cvs.php.net</tt></span>, and the repository folder is
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>/repository</tt></span>. If you have a CVS account, please use your
    own user name; otherwise, use <span dir="ltr"><tt>cvsread</tt></span>; and the module,
    of course, is <span dir="ltr"><tt>php-gtk-doc</tt></span>. Under the current version
    of TortoiseCVS, the line endings are converted to Windows by default; we
    don't want this anywhere in the php.net repository, so if you're intending
    to commit any of your changes you should go to <span dir="ltr"><tt>Options</tt></span>
    and tick the box that says <span dir="ltr"><tt>Use UNIX line endings</tt></span>.
   </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="idp45203248"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp45203248"></a>Compiling the Standard Build</h3></div></div><p>
    From the commandline, move into the php-gtk-doc directory via the command
    <b>cd php-gtk-doc</b>. Type <b>autoconf</b> to set
    up the configuration file.
   </p><p>
    There is full internationalisation (i18n) support in this build system,
    with the default configuration being English (en). If you are compiling
    for any language other than English, you will need to supply the configure
    line with the language code for that language, e.g.
    <b>./configure --with-lang=de</b>. Note that this will only
    work if the base files for the German translation happen to exist!
   </p><p>
    Another configure option you may need to use is
    <b>--with-php=PATH</b>, where <span dir="ltr"><tt>PATH</tt></span> is the
    full path to the PHP binary executable you intend to use. In most cases,
    the PHP 4 or PHP 5 binary found automatically by autoconf will be fine
    - but occasionally people have strange setups on their systems. You really
    should be using CLI for building, by the way, but CGI will generally cope.
   </p><p>
    You can prevent the chunked builds (<span dir="ltr"><tt>html</tt></span>,
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>phpweb</tt></span>, <span dir="ltr"><tt>test</tt></span>) from telling you
    every time they write a file by using <b>--disable-output</b>.
    In theory at least, this should speed up the build time for those versions.
   </p><p>
    There is one last configuration option, <b>--with-history</b>,
    which you may or may not fall across. It's used to define the path to an
    external directory containing only <span dir="ltr"><tt>manual/*</tt></span> (a snapshot
    of <span dir="ltr"><tt>php-gtk-doc/manual</tt></span>). This is only used during the
    <b>make updates</b> option, which is primarily there to
    generate the updated documentation lists on the server. You won't need it.
   </p><p>
    Finally, there is a choice of output style. Choosing
    <b>make bigmanual.html</b> will give you a single, huge HTML
    file in less than five minutes; <b>make text</b> will do the
    same, but will also produce a copy of the manual as a single text file
    at the end of the build run. <b>make html</b> will eventually
    produce multiple HTML files in split directories alongside a copy of the
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>images</tt></span> directory; <b>make phpweb</b> will
    result in a copy of the manual as it appears on gtk.php.net. By popular
    demand, there is now also <b>make test id=ID</b>, where
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>ID</tt></span> is the manual id for a component, e.g.
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>tutorials.helloadvanced</tt></span>
    or <span dir="ltr"><tt>gtk.gtkwindow</tt></span>. This will build the relevant file -
    and anything below it in the hierarchy - into a toplevel directory named
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>testbuild</tt></span> rather than into <span dir="ltr"><tt>build</tt></span>.
   </p><p>
    There are two output types you are very unlikely to need at all:
    <b>make mtoc</b>, which generates a machine-readable table of
    contents in XML, and <b>make updates</b>, which is used on the
    build server to generate the manual updates list for the home page at
    <a href="http://gtk.php.net/" target="_top">http://gtk.php.net/</a>.
   </p><p>
    Further output formats are likely to become available in the near future.
   </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="idp45229056"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp45229056"></a>Compiling the Alternative Build</h3></div></div><p>
    From the commandline, change into the php-gtk-doc directory via the command
    <b>cd php-gtk-doc</b>. Now set up some basic
    files: <b>./runfirst.sh</b> (or
    <b>sh ./runfirst.sh</b> if you are working under Windows). The
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>runfirst</tt></span>-script has only to be called again if
    completely new files have been added to the manual, or if the build date
    needs to be updated. So if you want to compile the manual on a daily basis,
	you should do that every time.
   </p><p>
    Let's generate the manual itself: At first you must understand that
    the php-gtk manual exists in different languages, in addition to
    the different formats mentioned earlier. So when compiling, you
    need to know which manual you want to compile. The language is
    determined as two-letter code, such as <span dir="ltr"><tt>en</tt></span> for
    English, <span dir="ltr"><tt>de</tt></span> for German and so on. The type
    is one of <span dir="ltr"><tt>html</tt></span> for the normal html documentation
    you can download from <a href="http://gtk.php.net/" target="_top">gtk.php.net</a>,
    <span dir="ltr"><tt>phpweb</tt></span> to generate the files like the online docs 
    at the PHP-GTK site, or <span dir="ltr"><tt>test</tt></span> if you want to
    compile a part of the files only.
   </p><p>
    So we call <b>./gen_manual.sh &lt;language&gt; &lt;type&gt;</b>,
    for example <b>./gen_manual.sh en html</b>. You will see
    the lines flowing over the terminal; go somewhere and come back in ten
    minutes - it will take some time. The files will be generated in the
    build directory <tt>build/&lt;language&gt;/&lt;type&gt;/</tt>,
    in our case <tt>build/en/html/</tt>
   </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="idp45242080"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp45242080"></a>Livedocs</h3></div></div><p>
    If you are an editor and just want to test if the section you just
    wrote is correct and renders as intended in html, you can call
    <b>./gen_manual.sh &lt;language&gt; test &lt;id&gt;</b>,
    as in <b>./gen_manual.sh en test gtk.gtkiconview</b>.
    This will enable a special mode in which the manual will be stripped
    down to a minimal version containing only the most necessary things
    to compile this special page (id). However, the script is not perfect
    and can (currently) generate reference files only, and in this many
    links just won't work.
   </p><p>
    If you have an Apache webserver with PHP installed, you can use livedocs:
    Open the <tt>live.php</tt> in your browser (on the webserver,
    not the local directory itself!) and browse through the manual - the pages
    are created on demand, most times as fast as 1 to 2 seconds.
